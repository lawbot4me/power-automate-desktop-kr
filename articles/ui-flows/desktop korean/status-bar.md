# The status bar

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The status bar on the bottom of the Window shows the status of the flow and the number of selected actions. Additionally, it shows the total number of actions and subflows in the current flow. The Run delay shows the amount of time that the flow waits for after running each action in the flow designer. Select the delay and use the slider to adjust the value in milliseconds to change this value. The status bar also shows the number of Errors, if any are present. Select the Errors to pop up the Errors pane. Using **Search inside the flow** shows an additional element with the number of results. Select the number of results to pop up the Find in code pane.
