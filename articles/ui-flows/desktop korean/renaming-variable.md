# Renaming a variable

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To rename a flow variable, make a right-click on its name in the **Variables** pane and select **Rename**. The name of the variable will be updated in all its occurrences.

Although you can update variables' names manually through actions, the name will be changed only in these specific actions, not globally. 

To update the name of an input/output variable globally, right-click on its name in the **Variables** pane and select **Edit**.

In the **Edit variable** dialog box, populate the **Variable name** and **External name** fields for the internal and external variable name, respectively.
