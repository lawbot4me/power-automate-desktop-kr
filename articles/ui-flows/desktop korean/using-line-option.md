# Using the Go to line option

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Go to line function navigates to a specific line within the current subflow. This function is helpful in subflows which contain a large number of actions. 

Select **Edit**, then **Go to line** and enter a line. The corresponding action will be highlighted.
