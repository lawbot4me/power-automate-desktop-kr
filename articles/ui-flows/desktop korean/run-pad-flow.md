# Run a Power Automate Desktop flow

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

To run a flow from the console, either select a flow and select **Run** or right-click on the flow and select **Start**.

![Select run flow button](\media\run-pad-flow\run-flow.png)

Flows running from the console will run from beginning to end without the Run delay. Running flows from the console will also ignore any breakpoints placed in the flow designer.
