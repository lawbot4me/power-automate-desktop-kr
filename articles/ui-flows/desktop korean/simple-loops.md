# Simple loops

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The idea behind a loop is to make a flow repeat one or more actions multiple times. Power Automate Desktop implements the simplest type of loops with the **Loop** action.

This loop repeats the actions between the **Loop** and **End** actions for a set number of times. A loop index variable is created automatically to track the current iterationâ€™s number.

A simple loop is ideal to use in two cases:

1. The exact number of times that a block of actions should be repeated is known.

1. The loop index variable must be used somewhere inside the loop.

In case you need to exit the loop before the specified iterations are completed, use the **Exit loop** action. To skip the current iteration, use the **Next loop** action.
