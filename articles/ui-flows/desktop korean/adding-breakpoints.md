# Adding breakpoints

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Click to the left of the running order number in the workspace to place a breakpoint in the flow, which appears as a red dot. Add a breakpoint to specify at which action to pause the flow. Resume running the flow by selecting **Run** or **Run next action**. Select the breakpoint to remove it.
