# Input and output variables

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Automate Desktop enables data exchange with the Power Automate platform through the input and output variables.
<!--note from editor: We do not use bold font on names like this. -->

These variables are passed to and from Power Automate Desktop, allowing you to create sophisticated flows. Î™n Power Automate, any input variables will be added to the UI action as fields. You can find more information about passing data between Power Automate Desktop and Power Automate in [Link a Power Automate Desktop flow with a flow](link-pad-flow-portal.md).
<!--note from editor: Suggest for this previous sentence "You can find more information about passing data between Power Automate Desktop and Power Automate in <add article title as a link>."-->

To create an input or output variable, select the **+**  button in the [**Variables**](manage-variables.md) pane and choose the respective option.
<!--note from editor: Instead of using the + button, use the name that appears when you hover over the + sign and possibly put the plus sign after it like this <name of button> (+). -->

In the **Add a new input variable** dialog box, populate the following fields:
- **Variable type**: Defines if the variable is input or output.
- **Variable name**: The name of the variable in the flow.
- **Default value**: The default value when the flow runs from the Power Automate Desktop flow designer or the Power Automate Desktop console.
- **Data type**: The type of the variable, like number, text, or datetime.
- **External name**: The name used outside the flow. The external name is the name that will appear in Power Automate.
