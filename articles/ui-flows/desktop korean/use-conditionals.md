# Making use of conditionals

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Conditionals allow you to execute blocks of actions only if a given condition is met. If the condition is false, the block of actions will be skipped.

Using conditionals, you can ensure certain elements have a wished value or state before performing other actions. For example, you can check if a file exists before trying to rename it.
