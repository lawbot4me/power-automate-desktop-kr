A message from the browser may appear, asking whether to allow flow.microsoft.com to open an application. Allow this action to continue to Power Automate Desktop.

Power Automate Desktop opens the console window and a flow designer window to edit the new flow with the selected name.

Design and save your flow, then close flow designer. Select **Keep Working** to return to Power Automate.
