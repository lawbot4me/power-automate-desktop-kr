# Run, stop, and pause in flow designer

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Select **Run** to run the flow. When the flow runs, **Run** becomes **Pause**. Select **Pause** while the flow is running to pause and inspect any changes up to that point. Select **Run** while the flow is paused to resume it. The **Run next action** button runs the flow action by action and pauses it after each action completes. The **Stop** button stops the flow completely.
